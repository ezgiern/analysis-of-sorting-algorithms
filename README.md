## Introduction

The goal is to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms under various input conditions and analyze their time complexities.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `AlgoInput.txt`: Contains the input datasets.
- `AlgoRaporFinal.docx` and `AlgoRaporFinal.pdf`: Final report documenting the analysis and results.
- `InsertionSort.java`, `InsertionSort.class`: Insertion sort implementation.
- `MaxHeap.java`, `MaxHeap.class`: Max heap implementation.
- `MergeSort.java`, `MergeSort.class`: Merge sort implementation.
- `NthSmallest.java`: Implementation for finding the nth smallest element.
- `QuickSort.java`, `QuickSort.class`: Quick sort implementation.
- `QuickSelect1.java`, `QuickSelect1.class`: Quick select with first element pivot.
- `QuickSelect2.java`, `QuickSelect2.class`: Quick select with median-of-three pivot.
- `QuickSelect3.java`, `QuickSelect3.class`: Quick select with median-of-medians pivot.
- `excel.xlsx`: Excel file with performance data and graphs.
- `Test.java`, `Test.class`: Test cases for the algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following algorithms are implemented and analyzed in this project:

1. **Insertion Sort**
2. **Max Heap**
3. **Merge Sort**
4. **Quick Sort**
5. **Quick Select with First Element Pivot**
6. **Quick Select with Median-of-Three Pivot**
7. **Quick Select with Median-of-Medians Pivot**

## Dataset

The datasets used for the analysis include:

- Sorted list of 10 elements.
- Reverse sorted list of 10 elements.
- Randomly generated lists of various sizes and ranges.
- Special cases such as lists with all identical elements.

## Performance Analysis

The performance of each algorithm is measured in nanoseconds for precise time complexity analysis. The results are presented in milliseconds for better readability in graphs.

## Results

The results are documented in the final report (`AlgoRaporFinal.docx` and `AlgoRaporFinal.pdf`). The report includes:

- Detailed experiment design.
- Reasonable inputs and metrics.
- Coding and execution.
- Visual representation of results.
- Comparison and analysis of theoretical expectations vs. found results.
